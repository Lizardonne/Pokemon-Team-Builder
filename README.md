# CS 260
For this lab, you will create a website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to previous labs. You must create your own original work.

Your main goal with this project is to connect to an API using JavaScript, like what we did with Lab 2. You should find an open API (e.g. free, but perhaps requires registration), and write a site that uses this API to present the data.

You should look at this list of open APIs (Links to an external site.). Avoid APIs that use OAuth for authentication, unless you are already familiar with how to implement this or are an experienced JavaScript programmer. Be careful to choose one that has YES listed for CORS. This means you can use purely client-side code to fetch data from the API.

This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:
-The site uses JavaScript and fetch to get data from an external API
-The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.

We will grade your projects based on:
-how clearly you present the data from the API
-how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

TAs will assign scores in these ranges:
-90-100: Excellent presentation of data from the API, clearly follows web design principles
-80-90: Uses an external API, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
-70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using an API, but does not make a strong effort to present the data clearly or follow web design principles
